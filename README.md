Inspired by the Radio Shack "Goofy Lite" P-Box kit, this is a strip of 5 neon (NE2) lamp relaxation
oscillators.

The lamps can be configured to flash sequentially or randomly depending on how some capacitors are
loaded.

# Power input is 90 - 120 Volts, so caution must be used!
# The author takes no respnsibility for unsafe or foolish use of this circuit!
# Be CAREFUL!

# If you do not have experience working with high voltages, make sure you get someone experienced to
# help you.
